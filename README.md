# Expense Tracker API

A secure, production-ready RESTful API built with **FastAPI** + **MySQL**, allowing users to track, filter, and manage personal expenses, generate reports, and export data.

---

## Problem Statement

Many people still track their expenses using spreadsheets or manual notes, which are error-prone and offer no insights. This API enables users to record, manage, and analyze their expenses in a clean and efficient way.

---

## Features (MVP)

- User registration and JWT-based login
- Add, update, delete, and view expenses
- Categorize expenses
- Filter expenses by date and category
- Monthly expense summary reports
- Export data to CSV
- Secure, token-protected endpoints

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

- As a user, I want to register and log in to track my expenses securely.
- As a user, I want to view all my expenses by date and category.
- As a user, I want to add, update, and delete my own expenses.
- As a user, I want to download my expenses as a CSV file.
- As a user, I want to see monthly summaries to understand my spending.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (do NOT commit it).  
Use `.env.example` as a reference.

```
DATABASE_URL=
SECRET_KEY=
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

## Run the Project (Dev)

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

---

## Security & Auth

- Passwords are hashed (bcrypt)
- JWT tokens used for secure access
- All user-specific data is isolated

---

## Deployment Plan (Coming Soon)

- Dockerize the app
- Add production environment configs
- Deploy to Fly.io or Railway with CI/CD
